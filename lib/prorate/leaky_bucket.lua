-- to have a little cushion.

-- case we default to 0

-- immediately overflow the bucket and trigger the throttle, on the first call.

-- Most Redis adapters when used with the Lua interface truncate floats
-- to integers (at least in Python that is documented to be the case in

-- We need access to the bucket level as a float value since our leak rate might as well be floating point, and to achieve that
-- we can go two ways. We can turn the float into a Lua string, and then parse it on the other side, or we can convert it to
-- a tuple of two integer values - one for the integer component and one for fraction.
-- Now, the unpleasant aspect is that when we do this we will lose precision - the number is not going to be
-- exactly equal to capacity, thus we lose the bit of information which tells us whether we filled up the bucket or not.
-- Also since the only moment we can register whether the bucket is above capacity is now - in this script, since
-- by the next call some tokens will have leaked.
